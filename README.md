# GateLLM

**GateLLM** is an open-core gateway for secure, private, and controlled access to large language models (LLMs). Built with students, independent developers, and privacy-conscious startups in mind, GateLLM helps you:

- Stop prompt injection attacks
- Route and monitor API usage securely
- Keep your LLM workflows safe and auditable

This repo is under early development. Stay tuned.

## Open-Core Notice

The core gateway code and CLI are open source. Enterprise features (such as user dashboards, telemetry, and threat detection) are developed separately and not included in this repo.
